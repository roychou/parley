"""
Temporal validity — separating training-contaminated decision dates from clean ones.

The foundational flaw of an LLM-driven backtest (productization.md Phase 0.0): a
decision the model makes about a date *inside its training window* is contaminated by
the model's memory of what those tickers did. Point-in-time data hygiene does not fix
it — the leakage is in the weights. The only clean evaluation is decision dates strictly
*after* the specialist models' training cutoff (plus forward paper trading).

This module makes the split explicit so the runner can:
- report how many decision dates are clean vs. contaminated, and
- optionally restrict a run to the clean (post-cutoff) window.

The cutoff is **operator-supplied and must be verified per model** — there is no
reliable programmatic source, and guessing wrong silently re-contaminates the result.
When it's unset, every result is treated as engineering validation, not edge evidence.
