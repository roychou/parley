"""
One-off probe: does FMP's *paid* tier serve survivorship-bias-free (delisted)
historical prices via the endpoint our data layer already uses?

Run this AFTER upgrading FMP, with FMP_API_KEY set in .env:

    uv run python scripts/fmp_survivorship_probe.py

It checks a few known-delisted S&P 500 names against `historical-price-eod/full`
(the endpoint `src/data/fmp_client.get_historical_prices` calls). Interpretation:

- PASS: delisted names return real history that TERMINATES at/near the delisting
  date (not empty, not 402, not running to today). => the existing fmp_client is
  survivorship-free on this tier; no new integration needed, just upgrade.
- FAIL: delisted names come back EMPTY / 402. => the standard endpoint is NOT
  survivorship-free on this tier; you'd need FMP's dedicated (Legacy-tagged)
  survivorship endpoint — treat that deprecation flag as a red flag and prefer a
  purpose-built source (Sharadar).

The live control (AAPL) should run to ~today. See the data-source discussion in
notes/ for why this gate matters.
